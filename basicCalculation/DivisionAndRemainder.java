/*Create a program called DivisionAndRemainder that first inputs two integers x and y from the user.
 *  Then the program should determine if the integers are even or odd. In addition, 
 *  the program should compute the remainder of x / y and the remainder of y / x. 
 * â€¢ You can suppose that the user does not ever enter a zero.
 * 	Enter x: 12
	Enter y: 9

	12 is even
	9 is odd
	The remainder of 12 / 9 is 3
	The remainder of 9 / 12 is 9*/
