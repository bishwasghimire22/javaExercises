/*Create a program called SoftDrinks  that first inputs the number of students and the number of soft drink bottles from the user. 
 * Then the program should compute how many bottles of soft drinks there are per student and how many leftover bottles there will be. 
 * Each student should get the same number of bottles. 
 *  â€¢ You can suppose that the user does not ever enter a zero. 
 *  Enter the number of students: 2
	Enter the number of bottles: 6
	
	There will be 3 bottles for each student.
	There will be 0 leftover bottles*/
