/*Create a program called BeachVolleyball for dividing expenses in a group of people who rent a beach volleyball court.  
 * The program should first input the number of people, the hourly rate of a court, and the length of rental in full hours. 
 * Then the program should calculate how much each of them should pay. 
 * The program should display the sum with two decimals. 
 * â€¢ You can suppose that the user does not ever enter a zero.
	Enter the number of people: 5
	Enter the hourly rate: 20,50
	Enter the length of the rental (hours): 3
	
	Each of the 5 people should pay 12,30 euros.
