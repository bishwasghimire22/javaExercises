/* Create a program called MealProgram that calculates the cost of a meal at a restaurant. 
 * The program should input the cost of the food, the tax rate, and the tip percentage (before tax) from the user. 
 * Then the program should calculate and print the total cost of the meal as shown in the example output.
 *  â€¢ The program should accept both comma and dot as decimal part separator. 
 *  	Enter the price of food: 20.00
		Enter the tax rate: 10.0
		Enter the tip percentage: 15.0

		The total cost is 25,00*/
